Basic matrix derivative example.  Builds a random matrix of specified size.  Computes finite difference dx and dy.  Computes min/max of dx and dy matrices.

To build:

g++ -O3 main.cpp Matrix.cpp -o Convolve

To run:
./Convolve 10 20


There is a multi-threaded version in multi-thread.  But it's actually slower.
